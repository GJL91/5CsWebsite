						The <a href="http://en.hospice.by/" target="_blank">Belarusian Children's Hospice (BCH)</a> is 
						the leading children's hospice-at-home service in the Russian speaking countries. It provides 
						palliative care for children throughout Belarus and supports their families. BCH is a registered 
						Belarusian charity based in Minsk, the capital of Belarus, which is located just north of Chernobyl.
					</p>
					<p class="block-text">
						The core purpose of BCH is to help families to care for their children with life-limiting and
						life-threatening illnesses at home which means that these children do not have to spend months
						or even years in hospitals.  BCH provides medical, social and psychological support for terminally
						and chronically ill children and their families on their journey through life to death free of charge. 
						Its aim is to maintain the best quality of life possible for the child and create positive experiences
						during a brief life which become precious memories for the family.
					</p>
					<p class="block-text">
						When BCH opened in 1994, it was the first children's hospice in the former Soviet Union and cared
						for just a few children.  Today, it cares for 300 children and young people each year.
