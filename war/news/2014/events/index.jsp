						<p class="block-text">
							This summer marked the ninth year that The 5Cs have sent volunteers to the Belarusian Children's
							Hospice summer camp in Zabrodia.
						</p>
						<p class="block-text">
							This summer our chair person, Bethan Powell stayed for the whole 10 weeks and two other supervisors,
							Zachary Thomas and Dafydd Gape, joined her for half the time each.  Whereas in the past few years,
							the supervisors have stayed off the camp and joined in where needed, this all three of them stayed on
							the camp and were part of the team for each group. This gave us a fantastic overview of the project
							from beginning to end and we feel it was beneficial in knowing how to further support the camp and
							volunteers in the future. Beth says &ldquo;As exhausting as it was, it was very useful from a 5Cs point of view,
							I saw all the children, all the volunteers, all the problems we faced and was able to really review in
							what ways we can further develop the project and support everyone better. I was a volunteer on the team,
							assigned to a child, on the cleaning rotas and up all night preparing games and activities along with the
							other volunteers for all the groups- it was the biggest challenge of my life but also one of the best
							decisions I have made so far- I had the time of my life!&rdquo;
						</p>
						<p class="block-text">
							We saw over 70 children and over 100 volunteers, coordinators, nurses, leaders, cooks, ambassadors,
							film crews, interviewers, translators, sponsors, builders, clowns and tri-athletes as well as countless
							other visitors over the course of ten weeks and five sessions.
							As ever, both the 5Cs volunteers and the rest of the volunteer team were fantastic in helping to care for
							the children and preparing brilliant activities and games for them. We had themed days including underwater,
							Olympic, business, Spa, talent show, Eco, Christmas, even time travel! As well as the favourite National
							Days of the volunteers- this year ranging from Welsh (of course!) to Romanian, German and Belarusian. Some
							of the children that visit the camp need 24 hour care with many aspects of their lives, including showering,
							toileting and eating. All the volunteers do a great job- adapting to their role very quickly- most of them
							with no previous experience. Bearing in mind the 5Cs volunteers don’t speak Russian and not many of the
							children speak English, the way that they find creative ways of communicating and take everything in their
							stride never fails to amaze us. All of the groups were so close by the end that there were always lots of
							tears when the bus came to collect everyone to go home!

							On Saturday 19th April we held an excellent and extremely successful Garden Party themed cocktail party
							raising over £700. As always a huge thank you to all the members that made the event the success that it was.
						</p>
						<p class="block-text">
							Thank you to everyone who came and supported us, we hope you had a good time and that you will come to the next one!
						</p>
						<p class="block-text">
							This £700 will go a long way when we donate it for the opening of the Summer Camp that so many of you lovely
							people will be volunteering at in the summer.
						</p>
						<p class="block-text">
							We look forward to seeing you all again soon.
