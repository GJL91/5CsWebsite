							We took a total of 30 volunteers to the Summer Camp this summer consisting of current members, team
							leaders and trustees and wonderful new volunteers from the Interact Clubs of Whitchurch High School
							and Howell's School of Llandaff.

						<p class="block-text">
							As last year, the volunteers were either child care, being a part of an international team helping
							with the every day to day running of the camp, or maintenance, being a part of a team that maintains
							the camp for the winter months and keep the camp looking vibrant. On top of this the maintenance team
							also started the clearing of land this year, which will in the future be home to The Five C's
							volunteers and guest house.
						</p>
						<p class="block-text">
							All the volunteers were amazing ambassadors for The Five C's and we hope you all enjoyed yourselves.
							We have had some amazing feedback from the Belarusian Children’s Hospice staff and it would not be the
							success that it is or the amazing experience for the Children without your hard work and dedication - Thank you!!
