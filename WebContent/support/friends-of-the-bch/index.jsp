						Friends of the Belarusian Children's Hospice UK (FoBCH) supports the Belarusian Children's
						Hospice, the same as we do and as such we work very closely together to achieve the goals
						of the Hospice.
					</p>
					<p class="block-text">
						FoBCH also supports the wider hospice movement in Belarus and countries of Eastern Europe
						and the former Soviet Union initiated and led by staff and parents of the Belarusian
						Children's Hospice.

						Since 1998, we have helped to fund BCH staff salaries, medical and other equipment, buildings
						and the summer holiday programme.  In addition, we make major contributions to BCH staff
						training, strategic development and management decision making.
