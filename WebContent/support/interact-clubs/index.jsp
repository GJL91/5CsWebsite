						The Five C’s involvement in the Summer Camp Project started with a group of Interactors
						from the club at Whitchuch High School being taken over to Zabrodya in Belarus by the then
						Chairperson, Kay Hailes, to help with the maintenance of the camp.
					</p>
					<p class="block-text">
						Since then the project has grown and with it so has the Five C’s involvement. Now we not
						only supply volunteers from the one Interact Club but from 3 different Interact Clubs
						associated with the Rotary Club of Cardiff Breakfast as well as other volunteers that get
						in touch. On top of this we now, not only supply volunteers for the upkeep of the maintenance
						on the camp, but also provide a large portion of the volunteers needed for the child care groups.
					</p>
					<p class="block-text">
						A huge thank you goes to the Interact Clubs of Whitchurch High School, Howells School and Cathedral
						School, all located in the wonderful city of Cardiff, for all your on-going support.
