					<h5>Summer 2012</h5>
					<p class="block-text">
						We sent 28 volunteers to the camp this summer, consisting of past volunteers and members as well
						as new faces from the Interact clubs of Howell's School Llandaff and Whitchurch High School in Cardiff.
					</p>
					<p class="block-text">
						Some of the volunteers were appointed for child care, helping the camp to run day to day. They worked
						hard as part of an international volunteer group to plan all the activities and keep the camp running
						smoothly. Another group of volunteers maintained all of the buildings to last the winter in preparation
						for next year.
					</p>
					<p class="block-text">
						We have had great feedback from the Hospice about all our volunteers. We hope they all valued the 
						experience and take away some great memories from their summer with the children of the Belarusian 
						Children’s Hospice.
					</p>
					
					<h5>May Trip</h5>
					<p class="block-text">
						Bethan Powell and Zachary Thomas went on a spring trip to Belarus where they delivered the money that
						has been raised through the year, a total of $5000 to the Director of the Hospice, Dr Anna Gorchakova,
						along with needed supplies to the Summer Camp such as paint and food for the volunteers in the summer. 
						They also met and discussed the volunteering in the summer with the relevant Hospice staff while they were
						in Minsk and all is underway to be a successful summer.
					</p>
					
					<h5>Mad Hatters Tea Party</h5>
					<p class="block-text">
						The second of the fundraisers to be carried out by the new Five C's team was a Mad Hatters Tea Party which
						took place in Whitchurch Community Centre.
					</p>
					<p class="block-text">
						It was a huge success and our thanks go out to everyone who gave up their time to come and for those who
						helped on the day. It was an amazing fun filled day raising over £800 towards our £3000 target to pay for
						the opening and running of the Summer Camp in the summer, of which Interactors from Whitchurch High School
						and Howell's School are going to be volunteering this summer along with some of our members.
					</p>
					
					<h5>Whitchurch High School Interact Club</h5>
					<p class="block-text">
						The Interact club at Whitchurch High donated £2300 to the Five C's this year, raising it through various
						activities including a sky dive in March which four of them took part in.
