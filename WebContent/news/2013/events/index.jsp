					<h5>An Evening with Miss Jones!</h5>
					<p class="block-text">
						Our Fundraising efforts for the opening of the camp in 2014 were started in style at a local
						Cocktail Bar in Whitchurch, Cardiff called Miss Jones. We had a brilliant three course meal 
						and entertainment, a great raffle, lots of dancing and cocktails too! Over 100 people came 
						and were very generous.

						leaders and trustees and wonderful new volunteers from the Interact Clubs of Whitchurch High School
						and Howell's School of Llandaff.
					</p>
					<p class="block-text">
						As last year, the volunteers were either child care, being a part of an international team helping
						with the every day to day running of the camp, or maintenance, being a part of a team that maintains
						the camp for the winter months and keep the camp looking vibrant. On top of this the maintenance team
						also started the clearing of land this year, which will in the future be home to The Five C's
						volunteers and guest house.
					</p>
					<p class="block-text">
						All the volunteers were amazing ambassadors for The Five C's and we hope you all enjoyed yourselves.
						We have had some amazing feedback from the Belarusian Children’s Hospice staff and it would not be the
						success that it is or the amazing experience for the Children without your hard work and dedication - Thank you!!
					</p>

						We also met with the Hospice staff to discuss all aspects of the Five C's work.
					</p>
					
					<h5>International VarieTea</h5>
					<p class="block-text">
						The first fundraiser of 2013 was an International Tea Party. We raised a total of £363.22 and it was a
						resounding success. As usual this would not have been the case, if not for our wonderful members who worked
						so hard serving up the tea and cakes.
