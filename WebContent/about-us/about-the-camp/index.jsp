						BCH provides short breaks for life-limited children at its main hospice centre in Minsk.  There
						are three bedrooms where children can be looked after by a dedicated BCH nurse 24 hours a day.
						The children look forward to their stay away from home and their parents or permanent carers are
						given free time to devote to their other children, socialise or take a short holiday. 
					</p>
					<p class="block-text">
						For longer respite care, BCH has its own specially adapted holiday complex in the countryside
						about an hourâ€™s drive outside Minsk. Here, hospice children and young people can holiday in
						groups of up to 12 at a time.  They are cared for by BCH staff assisted by an army of volunteers
						who arrive from all over Belarus and abroad each summer.  There is also purpose built accommodation
						for up to three families at any one time so that mum, dad and brothers and sisters can have a
						holiday together with their life-limited child.  Everyone benefits enormously from fresh air
						and sunshine and many lasting friendships are made here.
